# Question of Interest

This project investigates the relationship between mental health, geographic designation (rural, urban, or frontier), and whether there is a mental health shortage in California emergency departments in 2022 as collected by California’s Department of Health Care Access and Information.

# About the Dataset

This dataset, from Data.gov, provides information about the State of California emergency department and capacity from 2021 to 2023. The data was published by the state of California, specifically California’s Department of Health Care Access and Information. The page is also maintained by the state as opposed to the federal government.

The data was collected from California’s hospitals. The dataset observes 18 possible variables: OSHPD_ID, facility name, county name, system, licensed bed size, hospital ownership (government, independent, etc), urban-rural designation, teaching designation, health condition category, emergency department (ED) encounters, ED stations, ED burden, latitude of facility, longitude of facility, the status of primary care shortage, the status of mental health shortage, and the year of data collection. The OSHPD_ID, facility name, county name, system, licensed bed size, hospital ownership, urban-rural designation, teaching designation, status of primary care shortage, and status of mental health shortage are all categorical variables. The remaining variables are numerical.

Not every hospital has observations for each variable. There are 12,849 observations in total in the dataset or 12,848 observations not including the row with the variable labels. These observations include the same hospitals for each year with additional hospitals. According to Data.gov, the dataset was made to understand ED Burden (ratio of treatments and treatment stations). The more treatments or visits per ED station represents a higher burden whereas less treatments or visits per ED stations represents a lower burden. The burden per ED is categorized into 16 health related conditions including: active COVID-19, asthma, cancer, cardiac, COPD, COVID-19 history, diabetes, homeless, hypertension, mental health, obesity, pneumonia, respiratory, sepsis, stroke and substance abuse.

The particular variable of interest is the EDDXCount which represents the ED burden by category, in this case mental health. In order to analyze the variable of interest, the dataset analyzed also included the geographical designation (UrbanRuralDesi), the number of total ED visits (Tot_ED_NmbVsts), LATITUDE, LONGITUDE, and whether the hospital was in a mental health shortage area (MentalHealthShortageArea). EDDXCount had a range of numerical observations from 35 mental health cases to 15,062 cases. Hospitals could be sorted into either urban, rural, or frontier (even more rural than rural) geographical designations. The total number of ED visits were collected across all health conditions by hospital. Latitude and longitude refer to geographic position. Mental health shortage status was classified with a simple yes/no observation. The dataset only includes observations that are related to the mental health category and are from 2022.

There are 34 N/A observations across the original dataset. The variable with the most N/A observations was system which refers to the hospital system that the particular hospital is connected to. This makes sense because there are plenty of independent hospitals that are not part of a hospital network. However, in the refined data set with all analyzed variables and observations there were no N/A values.

# Analysis

The first visualization provides rudimentary insight into the geographic distribution of mental health shortage areas. The points on the map of California represent hospitals that had mental health cases in 2022 and whether those hospitals had mental health care shortages are indicated by color, pink for no and cyan for yes. The clusters of points indicate a higher populated area as it can be understood that more people would require more hospitals. These areas had a higher concentration of pink points. In context, the hospitals in higher populated areas are less likely to have mental health care shortages. This might be because there are more businesses catered toward mental health care or due to a higher concentration of highly organized institutions with more adequate health care for those who need mental health care. More highly populated areas also tend to be more progressive which may lead to more accessible mental health programs even for those who are not able to afford it whereas less populated areas are not able to afford to support mental health care for citizens both financially and because of a lack of mental health care professionals compared to population.

The second visualization gives insight on the relationship between the total amount of emergency department visits and the number of mental health visits. If there were no association, as the total number of ED visits increased the number of mental health ED visits would increase in equal proportion in relation to each of the other categories. Hypothetically, if a mental health shortage caused an increase in mental health cases, the points filled with cyan, representing the presence of mental health care shortages, would have a higher number of mental health ED visits per number of ED visits in total. This graph does not indicate any significant relationship between the presence of a mental health care shortage and the ratio of mental health ED visits per number of ED visits. The scatter of points is linear but relatively similar between hospitals with and without mental health care shortages. In fact, there seems to be a more random scattering of points without a mental health care shortage, implying that there may be another factor that impacts the number of mental health ED visits like the geographic designation.

The third plot investigates this idea of another possible variable, geographic designation, that impacts mental health burden on California’s emergency departments in 2022. The median number of mental health emergency department visits for frontier, rural, and urban hospitals is outside of the second and third quartiles of the other geographical designations. This suggests a possible statistically significant relationship between geographical designation and the number of mental health emergency department visits. Although this could mean that urban areas are more likely to have mental health related emergency department visits there is also the possibility that because urban areas have higher population density they simply have a higher number of cases overall. As demonstrated by plot 2, typically the more overall emergency department visits the more mental health cases. However, there could be differences in the number of mental health cases between hospitals in areas with shortages in mental health care within different geographic designations.

The fourth visualization looks at the impact of mental health care shortages and geographic designation on the average number of mental health related emergency department visits. In both the frontier and rural facets of the bar plot, the hospitals with mental health care shortages had a higher average of mental health related cases. The urban hospitals had the opposite relationship– the hospitals without mental health care shortages had a higher average of mental health cases.

# Conclusion

Overall, the strongest variables that impacted the burden of mental health cases on California’s emergency departments in 2022 were the presence of mental health care shortages in relation to the geographic designation. It is possible that there is an abundance of mental health care shortages around rural and frontier areas which leads to a more significant relationship than in urban areas. It is also possible that because urban hospitals are closer, there are mental health cases that originate from an area with a mental health care shortage that are treated at facilities that do not reside within areas with mental health care shortages. The map implies that in areas with higher population density there is less likely to be a mental health care shortage. There is also a direct relationship indicated between the number of total cases and the number of mental health cases but that is not impacted by whether or not the facility is within a mental health care shortage area or not.

A viable avenue for future research would be to look at these changes over time. However, this specific data set makes this avenue for future research particularly difficult because of the fact that the data is long and not wide. As attempting to make the data wide instead of long proved to be incredibly laborious due to the complexity of the data set it would be more beneficial to re-publish a summarized dataset that includes a wide view of the variables as opposed to long. This would make cleaning of data in order to do temporal analysis significantly easier. There is also no way to compare ED case variables proportionally to each other. This would allow for analysis of hospital ability to deal with mental health cases based on the case dependent burden and number of stations instead of just overall case number and number of stations which is more general.
