Claire Rhody's Project 1 for SDS 192

# Description

My project looks at how California emergency departments mental health cases
and if they are effected by whether there is a mental health shortage in the 
area or the geographic classification (rural, urban, or frontier) in 2022. The 
original data set comes from the California Department of Healthcare Access and 
Information from data.gov. The data was collected from between 2021 and 2023 by
the State of California.
